Question1:
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed a comma-seperated sequence on a single line.
Hints: Consider use range(#begin, #end) method


Question2: (Chapter 3):
Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element walue in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j. Note: i=0,1...,X-1; j=0,1,i-y-1. Example suppose the follwoing inputs are given to the program:3,5
Then, the output of the program should be:
[[0,0,0,0,0], [0,1,2,3,4], [0,2,4,6,8]]

Hint: Note: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input in a comma-seperated form.

Question3: (Chapter 3 Lists): 
Use a list of comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers. 
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
Then, the output should be:
1,3,5,7,9
Hints: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.


Question4 (Chapter 5):
Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world! 123
Then, the output should be:
Letters 10
Digits 3

Question5: Dictionary {1:1, 2:4, 3:9}
